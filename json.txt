full-length album, SLP2 [R&B Money/Atlantic Records], Tank posed a crucial question. He answered that question by crafting the long-awaited sequel to his influential 2007 opus, Sex, Love & Pain. That album not only provided a blueprint for the likes of Chris Brown, Trey Songz, and more, but it also debuted at #2 on the Billboard Top 200 and earned a Grammy Award nomination for \"Best R&B Album,\" while its #1 single \"Please Don't Go\" became nominated for \"Best R&B Male Vocal Performance.\" Following 2014's Stronger, Tank once again captured a creative spirit that resembled the process behind his seminal third body of work.","pleaseNote":"B.B.

Check here for availability: www.parkwhiz.com/gramercy","accessibleSeatingDetail":"Live Nation, on behalf of its clients, strives to make it as easy as possible to purchase accessible seating tickets for venues across the country. Most venues offer accessible seating areas to accommodate their guests. Availability and type of accessible seating tickets will vary based on each venue's policies and/or the type of event taking place. Note: Venues are solely responsible for establishing their own accessible seating ticket policies. Some venues sell all or a portion of their accessible seating tickets only through their box office and not through Live Nation. Order your tickets by phone at 1-800-745-3000 or request accessible seating tickets online by filling out and submitting the form below. Live Nation aims to process online requests for accessible seating tickets as soon as they are received, but heavy volume can result in delays. So, while you may receive an e-mail from a Live Nation e-care specialist within minutes after you have received the auto-acknowledgement, it could take longer (in rare instances more than an hour) before the e-care specialist contacts you. Once the e-care specialist does contact you, he or she will work with you to process and complete your request (subject, of course, to ticket availability). For help with problems or other inquiries, Live Nation customer service representatives are available 8am - 9pm (in each US time zone).","generalInfo":{"generalRule":"16 and over unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.
